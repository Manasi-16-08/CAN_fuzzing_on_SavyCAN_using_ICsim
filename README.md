# Problem Statement:- 
Developing a fuzzing strategy using SavvyCAN on ICSim to evaluate the robustness of automotive 
CAN (Controller Area Network) systems. Utilize frame sender, sniffer, and custom frame-sending 
techniques to inject malformed or unexpected CAN frames. Analyze the impact on ICSim's 
virtualized vehicle components to identify vulnerabilities, potential crashes, or unexpected 
behaviors. Document the findings and propose mitigations to enhance the security and reliability 
of automotive CAN networks. 
# Objective:- 
SavvyCAN on ICSim will be used to test and improve the security of automotive CAN systems. 
This involves: 
1. Sending unusual CAN frames. 
2. Monitoring vehicle responses. 
3. Identifying weaknesses. 
4. Suggesting improvements. 
5. Enhancing testing methods for better automotive cybersecurity.
